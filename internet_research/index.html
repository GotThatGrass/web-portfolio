                <h2>What <span>really</span> are emails?</h2>
                <p>
                    Most people use emails every day without knowing what is actually happening.
                    <br>
                    The way most people see emails is a simple way to send messages to other people.
                    <br>
                    However, emails are much more complex than that. Emails are a method of transferring information/messages across computer networks.

                <h2>How do emails work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Emails are sent through a series of steps and protocols. The three Internet Protocols used for email are SMTP, POP3, and IMAP. SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". This protocol sends email messages between the client and the server. POP3 stands for "Post Office Protocol version 3". It is one of the methods that clients can connect to the server, and it downloads emails from the server to the client by executing the download and then deleting it from the server, so it's only stored on the client. IMAP stands for "Internet Message Access Protocol". IMAP is the other main way clients can connect to the server, outside of POP3. The emails stay on the server, while the client just shows you what's there.
