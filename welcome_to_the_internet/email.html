                <h2>What are emails?</h2>
                <b>Emails</b> are a way to deliver messages across computer networks on the internet. Email has existed since the 1970s, when Ray Tomlinson created a way to transmit messages between computer systems for the ARPANET. Once development of email apps began, email became available for public use! Email is one of the most popular methods of communication online in the modern world. However, it's also appealing for scammers and hackers online, because of it's security vulnerabilities.

                <h2>How do emails work?</h2>
                Emails are sent through a series of steps and protocols. The three Internet Protocols used for email are <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), <b>POP3</b> (Post Office Protocol v3), and <b>IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</b>.
                <br><br>
                <b>SMTP</b> sends email messages between the client (apps that people use to send/recieve and look at emails) and the server (the back area that emails travel through).
                <br><br>
                <b>POP3</b> is one of the two methods that clients can connect to the server. It downloads messages from the server to the client and then removes the message from the server.
                <br><br>
                <b>IMAP</b> is the other and preferred method that clients can connect to the server. Email messages stay on the server, while the client just becomes a window into the server.
